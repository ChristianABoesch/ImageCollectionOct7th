Questions:
1. After pressing the "stop" button to stop the music, how can I make it so the song picks up from where it was stopped after pressing the "play" button again?
2. Is there a way to add the name of each image (aka the prompt) above or below the image when it appears? Or perhaps have the name appear when you hover over said image?
